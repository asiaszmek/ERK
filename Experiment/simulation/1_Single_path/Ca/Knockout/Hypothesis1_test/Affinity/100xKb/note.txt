Hypothesis test 1:
Is CamKII affinity to syngap high? Do we have an high amount of SynGap? 


Method:
_Use 100X rxn file
_change SynGap conc to 500 or 700 or keep 1000 (original)
_run for basal
_stimulate with Stim_ERK_Ca-C500-d10


Result:
_Slight change in basal due to Syngap phosphorylation (not so significant, fig ModelCaSyn_Kb.png)
_ Block then stim:
  _Blue are Syn 1000:
  when Cam SynGAp is blocked. ppERK stay at basal
  _redish and black; Syn 700
  higher basal ERK compare to Syn 1000
  same fold change as Syn 1000
  _greenish coler : Syn 500
  diff in basal; pSynGap block have a low basal compare to control and pSynden
  same fold change as syn 1000



Conclusion:
Kinetic of SynGap and CK inluence (is critical) ppERK amplitude and duration, not the amount of SynGap present 
SynGap concentration is not the cause of sustained ERK.
High kinetic is require for higher amplitude of ERK and keep it sustained above a Ca threhold
