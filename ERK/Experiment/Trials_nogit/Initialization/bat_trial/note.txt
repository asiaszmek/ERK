Test why i lost the constant part in stim bhalla:

_used .6 rate for dimer to MEK
_set up 2 differents model files with different rxn files:
   _1: Model_ERK-d.xml is used with only one dimer (dRaf1Ras)
   _2: Model_ERK-dd.xml is used with two dimers (dRaf1Ras and dRaf1bRaf)
_runned and copy IC and stim

_used 2 set of stim file
  _1: stim_ERK_Bhalla.xml: new version, does not shitf too much from the baseline and was on for really a sec
  2-stim_ERK_Bhallaold.xml: old version,high shitf from the baseline and was on for more than a sec

_set up 3 different Model stim files:
   _1: Model_ERK-stimd.xml is used with stim_ERK_Bhalla.xml
   _2: Model_ERK-stimdd.xml is used stim_ERK_Bhalla.xml
   _3: Model_ERK-stimdold.xml is used with stim_ERK_Bhallaold.xml

_runned and checked result with python


Result:

_higher production of ppERK with two dimers (basal)
_same fold change when stim with one or two dimers
_but ppERK of dd is little more sustained than d
_recovered plato using the old stim file (so the effect might be temporal, old stim file was less than a sec while new stim file was really a second. temp as a big effect) 
_Since cAMP stays longer, we have a sustained Rap1GTP (shape follows ppERK shape) 

_lower ppERK with two dimers than one dimer, why? 
_bRafRap1 activity is not higher in d than dd 
_difference is seen when binds to MEK but not pMEK which is weird... why??????????????????????????????????????????
