Test why lost the constant part when stim using Bhalla data:

_only change that I remenber making is the rate of the dimer binding

_runned three simulations:

1: Model_ERKbasal-R63 is where the rate are differents (first p is 0.6 and 2nd p is 0.3) (reverse cooperative) 

2. Model_ERKbasal-R33: rates are the same (non-cooperative) 


2. Model_ERKbasal-R36: (first p is 0.3 and 2nd p is 0.6) (cooperative)


_ copy data with Update_IC
_Stim with Stim_ERK_Bhalla (nogbg) 

the constant part was not observed..

*******************
next step:
rerun using old stim file (did in bat_trial)
