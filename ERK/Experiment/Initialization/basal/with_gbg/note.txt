get basal concentration with Gbg

_used data from troobleshoot/basal/newSyngaprate/2Kcat
_2Kcat mean that the the dimer to MEK kcat was double because it is more actif than the non dimers
_added 1nm of Gbg (in the cell there is no 0 nM, it might be low, so will like to check its effect on the model)
_runned for an hours and get steady state
_copy data using update_IC. py
_rerruned for 60 sec to make sure all is well
_used this IC file to validate model (bhalla folder)

_could not get steady state becaus of the Sos biding that doesnt not read ss
_runned it once and copy, then runned with copy but still no ss

_runned it a 3rd time, not basal but pretty close 

_copy and used


Result:
higher level of total RasGTP, (from below 20 to about 50) which is close to Rap1 contribution...
