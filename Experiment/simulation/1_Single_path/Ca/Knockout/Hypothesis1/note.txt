Hypothesis:
Ca above threshold through autophosphorylation of CamKII and syngap dispersion (by CamKII) cause prolong ERK

Method:
__Set desire knockout Kf to '0'
_run to get new basal
_copy new IC
_Delivered a single pulse of [Ca]=500 nM
_ Added more Ca to keep it high (no decay) before injecting the buffer to bring it back to basal

##########TEST 1: Block dispersion (no pSynden)

expect: lower ERK activity due to higher level of pSynGap (pSynGap have higher activity than SynGap towards RasGTP and RapGTP)


Result:
_lower ERK without pSynden (from 17 to 12 nM (for 10 sec)
_less prolong (from around 2200 to around 1600 sec)
_due to a lower Rap1 activity and shorter sustained pSynGAP
_ERK follows SynGap activity because about 2/3 of syngap stays bound to CamKII 

Conclusion: dispersion of syngap is needed for high level of ppERK 

##########TEST 2: Block CK activity towards SynGap (no pSynGap but CamKII autophosphorylation)
Expect: High level of ERK since SynGap has a lower activity than pSynGap 

Result:
_no change in Rap1GTP (control and dispersion_knockout has a change in Rap1GTP level)
_Lower production of RasGTP because no interaction with syngap increase as RasGTP increase.
_higher Syngap activity:
	_syngap activity towards RasGTP and RapGTP increase because more is available to bind since no longer attached to CamKII


##########TEST3: block all CK activity (no autophosphorylation of CamKII)
Expect: Transient ERK activity because all Cam will be available to RasGRF (no cam trapping by CamKII) 

Result:
_brief transient activation of ERK due  to RasGRF

*****************************Conclusion****************
Hypothesis is proven right at some point
prolong and sustained ERK is due to CamKII activity 
even though CK is not directly activating ERK, plays and important role in ERK activation
SynGap dispersion: increase prolong time (duration) and amplitude

*******unclear****
Test2 resuslt was not expected:
_1: Was CamKII affinity to Syngap high?
_2: did the system changed to follow the Ca pulse (concentration or duration)?
