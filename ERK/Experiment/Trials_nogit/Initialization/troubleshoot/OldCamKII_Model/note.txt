check old Cam model to see if it was bistable too


1. copy Cam data from neuroRD_fit, for Cam old (have Complex) into the ERK model

2. run the simulation for an hour

3. copy new IC (IC_ERK-Test_basal)

4. Stimulate the model with new IC file

(bistability was seen when added 100nm of Ca for a duration of 1000s)
(used the same data which are rate of 75 for a duration of 800000ms)


Result:
CamKII comes back to basal after Ca out

Conclusion:
the old model is not bistable

Next step:
why the new one is then bistable?
Try old pp1 rate to see if different
