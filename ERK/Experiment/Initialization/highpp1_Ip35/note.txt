increase  PP1 concentration to see if it it stays bistable too


1. add PP1 inhibitor rxn, and [Ip35]=500 nm 

2. run the simulation for an hour

3. copy new IC (IC_ERK-Test_basal)

4. Stimulate the model with new IC file

(bistability was seen when added 100nm of Ca for a duration of 1000s)
(used the same data which are rate of 75 for a duration of 800000ms)


Result:
CamKII doest comes back to basal after Ca out

Conclusion:
the amount of pp1 may play a role in bistability 

Next step:
Try using PP1 inhibitor along with 2000 nm PP1
