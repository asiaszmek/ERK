Hypothesis test 1:
Is CamKII affinity to syngap high?

Method:
_increase Kb by 10X and 100X
_run for basal
_stimulate with Stim_ERK_Ca-C500-d10


Result:
_Still high level of Syngap bound to CK
    _10X and 1X have the same quantity bound but different duration: 10X decay faster which is expected
    _100X is about half bound


_The amount and duration bound of syngap and CK dictate the amplitude and duration of ERK



Conclusion:
Kinetic of SynGap and CK inluence (is critical) ppERK amplitude and duration.
