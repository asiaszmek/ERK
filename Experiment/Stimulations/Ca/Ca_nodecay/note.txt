Ca pathway in the ERK cascade:
_used rxn, IC and morph file from Initialization folder
Ca can activate ERK through RasGRF or dispersion of pSynGap from the dendrite



*******************
_Delivered a single pulse of [Ca]=500 nM###################
_ Added more Ca to keep it high (no decay) before injecting the buffer to bring it back to basal

Result:

_ppERK is sustained at 4 sec and saturated 
_8 and 10 sec same shape, longest sustained portion, cant do more
_6 is a little less prolong than 8 and 10 sec


*********************************
compare no-decay with decay

_d10: no decay is more prolong (2000 sec compare with 1500 sec)

_d8: 2000 sec compare to 1000 sec

_d6: sustained with no_decay only

_d4: sustained with no-decay only

_d2: they overlap

_d1: they also overlap

difference is seen when SynGap is sustained 


************************
Hypothesis: sustained is due to autophosphorylation of CamKII and dispersion of SynGap ((((Test in knockout folder) ))))
