Test synergic activation of ERK with Ca and cAMP by blocking Rap1GTP-Raf1 interaction; hypothesis ; competitive effect between Ras and Rap

Method:
_below and above threhold of Ca (Ca duration of 10 and 2 sec) 
_below and above sustained ERK (cAMP duration of 500 and 10 sec)
_ block Rap1 binding to Raf then run for basal


Result:
Same result as test itself
     _sublinear activation of ERK: higher production of ERK than single but not addition
     _cAMP faster onset
     _Ca slow onset 
     _cAMP basal shift in dual input
_slighly higher than previous (about 2nM more or less) 


Conclusion:
competition between Ras and Rap do not affect the ERK activation even though a large amount is found in the inactive complex.
