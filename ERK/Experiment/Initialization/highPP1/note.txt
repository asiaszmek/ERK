increase  PP1 concentration to see if it it stays bistable too


1. increase pp1 from 900 to 2000 (double)

2. run the simulation for an hour

3. copy new IC (IC_ERK-Test_basal)

4. Stimulate the model with new IC file

(bistability was seen when added 100nm of Ca for a duration of 1000s)
(used the same data which are rate of 75 for a duration of 800000ms)


Result:
CamKII doest comes back to basal after Ca out

Conclusion:
the amount of pp1 may play a role in bistability 

Next step:
Try using PP1 inhibitor along with 2000 nm PP1
