Final version of the Model

1. Raf dimerization needed to be fully actif 
 C-Raf is only actif when it is homodimerized

2. Rates for RasGRF
Dr. Feig mentioned that Sos and RasGRF have similar affinity
So we use Sos affinit for Ras: a thenth of all rates and kept Km the same

3.Troubleshoot for Ca 
 _added different type of buffer such as pump, nxca, fixed buffer (CB)
 _20X lower rates for CB because it was too fast and slowing simulation. Plus lower rate do not affect our result
 _two type of calcium, internal and external Ca exchange through leak
 _add a pool of NgCam in order to have available Cam for RasGRF


4.Troubleshoot for cAMP
 _Production of cAMP to mimic AC production (only product  of cAMP, no reactant)
 _PDE2 and PDE4, true buffers to maintain the basal level of cAMP 



NEW UPDATE AUGUST
-CHANGED DEPTH FROM 4 RO 0.4
-INCREASE PUMP AND LEAK NEW CA BASAL IS 50 INSTEAD OF 45
-LOWER CB RATE (20x LOWER)
