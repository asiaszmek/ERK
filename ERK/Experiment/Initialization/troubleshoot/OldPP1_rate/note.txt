check old PP1 rate to see if it was bistable too


1. copy PP1 rates data from neuroRD_fit, for Camold  rxn file into the ERK model

2. run the simulation for an hour

3. copy new IC (IC_ERK-Test_basal)

4. Stimulate the model with new IC file

(bistability was seen when added 100nm of Ca for a duration of 1000s)
(used the same data which are rate of 75 for a duration of 800000ms)


Result:
CamKII doest not comes back to basal after Ca out (none or 100%0

Conclusion:
the rates are not cause of bistable

Next step:
Try higher pp1 rate to see if different
