stim inject Ca
NB: CamKII enhance ERK activity through Raf1 but inhibit ERK activity through SynGap



1. see effect of [Ca]=100nm for different set of duration time (temporal effect)



inject rate of 245 for 10000ms to get about 100 nm for a duration of 50s

inject rate of 100 for 65000ms to get about 100 nm for a duration for 100s

inject rate of 95 for 300000ms to get about 100 nm for a duration for 500s



Result:
enough RasGRF for Cam to bind ( because we added NgCam to contribute)
overall: degradtion of ppERK by a fold
because RaP1GTP is being degraded because of pSynGap activity.
There is no change for RasGTP but toward the end of the 500s RasGTP was starting to get a little higher


EpacRap1 in increasing while CRKC3GpCbl is decreasing?????
does Epac contribute more than PKA route?????


I believe that the Rap1 pathway contribute more than the Ras pathway to ERK
