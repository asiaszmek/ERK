Ca pathway in the ERK cascade:
_used rxn, IC and morph file from Initialization folder
Ca can activate ERK through RasGRF or dispersion of pSynGap from the dendrite

_Delivered a single pulse of [Ca]=500 nM
_let it sit for different set of time (decay) before injecting the buffer to bring it back to basal 

Result:
_ppERK remained elevated beyond stimulus
_Ca duration 0f 8 and 10 sec induces sutained ppERK
_RapGTP is sustained (match literature)
_B-Raf is the main contribitor ( match literature)
