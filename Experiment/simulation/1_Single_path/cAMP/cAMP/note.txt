Do Ca and cAMP work synergistically??/

Method:
_use Rnx and Ic file (no block)
_set different stim file with below threshold and above threshold for Ca and below sustain and above sustained for cAMP all with C500
  _Ca used d2 and d10
  _cAMP used d10 and d500



Result:
_Ca2-cAMP10: both below sustained



_Ca2-cAMP500: cAMP at sustained and Ca below sustained ppERK



_Ca10-cAMP10: Ca at sustained and cAMP below sustained ppERK




_Ca10-cAMP500: both above sustained




<<<<<<<<<<<<<how to record: get each alone amplitude and duration, then get together amplitude and duration. then compare them>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
