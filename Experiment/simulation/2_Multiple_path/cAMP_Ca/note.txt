Synergic activation of ERK by Ca and cAMP

Method:
_below and above threhold of Ca (Ca duration of 10 and 2 sec) 
_below and above sustained ERK (cAMP duration of 500 and 10 sec)
_ used regular IC basal and Rxn file from initiation file


Result:(figures are in fig folder in same folder) 
_sublinear activation of ERK: higher production of ERK than single but not addition
_cAMP faster onset
_Ca slow onset 
_cAMP basal shift in dual input
