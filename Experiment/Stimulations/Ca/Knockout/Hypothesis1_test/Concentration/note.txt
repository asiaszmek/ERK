Hypothesis test 1:
Is it concentration dependent now?


Method;
_use pSynGap block reaction file and basal
_stim with different concentration of Ca but same duration 10 sec


Result:
_no change in ppERK
_no chnage in Rap1GTP
_Ras GTP goes up but comes below basal befor getting back to basal. due to syngap activity


Conclusion:
Rap is the main contributor
syngap is require for ERK activation in our model
