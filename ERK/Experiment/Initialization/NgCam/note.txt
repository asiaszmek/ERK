try to suck up the Cam by adding neurogranin 
(Neurogranin (Ng) is a member of the IQ motif class of calmodulin (CaM)-binding proteins, and interactions with CaM are its only known biological function. Ng induced a >10-fold decrease in the affinity of Ca(2+) binding to the C-terminal domain of CaM with an associated increase in the Ca(2+) dissociation rate.  Hoffman L 2014 JBC)


1. add Ng=5000 nM 

2. run the simulation for an 30 min

3. copy new IC (IC_ERK-Test_basal)

4. Stimulate the model with new IC file

(bistability was seen when added 100nm of Ca for a duration of 1000s)
(used the same data which are rate of 75 for a duration of 800000ms)


Result:
CamKII doest comes back to basal after Ca out

Conclusion:
Even with high pp1, we cannot get rid of the bistability

Next step:
Try using Ng binding to Cam to compete with camkII
