For Calcium 
get 100 nm of Ca  for 50s 100s and 1000s

inject rate of 150 for 20000ms to get about 100 nm for a duration of 50s

inject rate of 100 for 65000ms to get about 100 nm for a duration for 100s

inject rate of 95 for 300000ms to get about 100 nm for a duration for about 500s

inject rate of 80 for 900000ms to get about 100 nm for a duration for 1000s




get 500 nm of Ca  for 50s and 500s

inject rate of 1360 for 2000ms to get about 500 nm for a duration of 50s

inject rate of 500 for 900000ms to get about 500 nm for a duration for 500s
