test model with Bhalla (2014) protocol to match experiment ( Racaniello et al., 2010)


Experiment: 1 sec train of 100 Hz in CA1 neuron

_no Gbg contribution
_used one dimer (Raf homodimerization) IC and Rxn files from basal folder
_experiment fold_change is about 2.5


_ Injected Ca to get [Ca]= 2000nm for a sec
_ Injected cAMP to get [cAMP]= 1000nm for a sec

Runned for an hours and check data

_fold_change of ppERK+pERK about 1.30 which is closer to experiment than Bhalla stim
_ Have a plato almost like the Expemient which bhalla does not have

Model is closer to exp than bhalla


_fold_change of ppERK about 1.80 which is closer to experiment than Bhalla stim
_ Have a plato almost like the Experiment which bhalla does not have

**************************************************************************
Conclusion:
our data and experiment exhibit rapid rise then plateau of ppERK
Our data has a faster rise:
    -delay maybe beacuse in slices takes a little while before reaction starts happening
