PKA robustness:

ppERK is insensitive to faster PKA talaitic activity (even though has a lower basal, delta is still the same)
same observation with higher Src.





Ca robustness:
Result are somewhat differnt and similar:
 1. higher peak ERK than control
 2. but both have a threshold: it is none or all
 3.both follows CKpCamCa (bound to synagap shape)
 3. old have higher GRF contribution (peak varies in oldCam) 


(I believe we will have same result with LTP, low ca massed preference and high ca spaced preference
