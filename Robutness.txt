Experiment robutness 

1: swap new CamKII with old CamKII model: check if bistability is needed OR is fiffernce is observed becose of the rate that was tunes. Tune old model and see if it is the same. 

2. increase ration of CamK to pp1  might influenc the bistability

3.role of syngap dispersion by not allowing the pSyngap to disperse (done)
 
4.adjust epac rate againt rap1 to see the effect

5. adjust pcbl--cbl rate to see the effect. does it change our result?

6. do the same pSos-Sos

7. allow Src to pCRaf-Ras and see how it changes our result?????? note that this reaction is proved right
however, pCRaf being actif itself is not 100% sure

8. swap with new PKA model 

9. (similar to 4,5, and 6) chnage sensible molucles rate by + or -10%   and see output change

10. Set o parameters we wna tto tune data and see if affect results
