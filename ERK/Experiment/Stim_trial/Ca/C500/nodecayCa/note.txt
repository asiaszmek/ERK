Inject Ca and keep at an high level


_ERK is sustained at 4 sec
_8 and 10 sec same shape, longest sustained portion, cant do more
_6 is a little less prolong


*********************************
compare no-decay with decay

_d10: no decay is more prolong (2000 sec compare with 1500 sec)

_d8: 2000 sec compare to 1000 sec

_d6: sustained with no_decay only

_d4: sustained with no-decay only

_d2: they overlap

_d1: they also overlap

difference is seen when SynGap is sustained
