test model validation with bhalla data

_used data from initialisation/basal/withgbg
_stim with Ca and cAMP (CC) and with Gbg(CCG)
_ runned for an hour and checked

Result:
high level of gbg cause a depression of ERK
maybe due to the negative feedback..


try without the negative feedback and see if the same...............
