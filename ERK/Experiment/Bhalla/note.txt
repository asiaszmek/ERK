test model with bhalla protocol

_no Gbg contribution
_used one dimer IC and Rxn files from basal folder

_ Injected Ca to get [Ca]= 2000nm for a sec
_ Injected cAMP to get [cAMP]= 1000nm for a sec

Runned for an hours and check data

_fold_change of about 1.30 which is closer to experiment than Bhalla stim
_ Have a plato almost like the Expemient which bhalla does not have

Model is closer to exp than bhalla

_why about 1.5 lower?
_what is missing or higher???
