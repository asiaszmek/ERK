Test why result channged after some change
 What changed from before
 1. fix buff added
 2. fix buffer rate adjusted but same affinity along with concentration
 3.pump increased and leak too (cncentration chnaged are in init folder)
 4. depth decreased
 5. increase pump a lot (50 to 500)  and leak (500 to 800, or 600 or 700 or 5000) 



Different trials to understand the change
1. oldppumm and leak and new [CB]
   result look like before
  so maybe it is the pump or the leak quantity or ratio, or the CB

2. old pump and leak and old  [CB]
    result is the same with new CB
    thus it is not the CB quantity
    therefore it is the pump and the leak quantity or ratio

3. new pum (500) and leak (800) with old  [CB] and new [CB]
ppERK dynamic changed, greater duration
rebound in pmca
